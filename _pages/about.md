Karttur is a private research and development company in Stockholm, Sweden. The company is owned and run by me, Thomas Gumbricht. The main focus is on modelling Earth system processes using a combination of spatial data and Artificial Intelligence (AI). Through its subsidiary, [xSpectre](https://xspectre.com), co-owned with some friends, Karttur is also involved in development of state-of-the-art sensing hardware.  

## Notable achievements

- Karttur developed the first [global pan-tropical wetland/peatland map](https://www2.cifor.org/global-wetlands/).
- Extensive research related to the [Okavango inland Delta, Botswana](https://karttur.github.io/okavango/).
- Karttur operates an open source in-house developed spatial data cube - [the GeoImagine Framework](https://karttur.github.io/geoimg/).
- Karttur has developed an open source modelling tool applying [Machine Learning for predicting soil properties](https://karttur.github.io/soil-spectro/).
